- 👋 Hi, I’m @CesarTorga

- 👀 I’m allways interested in new ways to solve problems. This repository works like a showcase for my projects (I know most of then are just too simple to be consider as projects, but I'd like to show then even though), for recruiters consideration mostly, but if you have time and interest in helping out some new dev fella, I'll allways be grateful.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET, Node.js and Java  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects with lots of knowledge and expeience to offer.
- 📫 You can allways reach me on my email: cesartorga@gmail.com or you can also send me a dm on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesartorga
